// Implement the function findKey which takes in an object and a callback. It should scan the object and return the first key for which the callback returns a truthy value. If no key is found, then it should return undefined.

const findKey = function(object,callback) {
let foundKey = Object.keys(object).find(key => object[key] === value);
